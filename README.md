# WebDataCrawling
Details of select web crawling projects I completed

1. Basic Webscraping
- Crawled two websites:  - https://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=1501390 and https://www.usnews.com/
- Extracted some interesting feature and sections using BeautifulSoup library

2. BarnesAndNobel
- Crawled the Barnes & Nobel website and dived into more specifics like listing top 100 books, collecting URLs of top books -- landing on those URLs (automatically through code) and extracting information from those web pages
