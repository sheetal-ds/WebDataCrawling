# WebDataCrawling
Details of select web crawling projects I completed

1. Basic Webscraping
- Crawled two websites:  - https://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=1501390 and https://www.usnews.com/
- Extracted some interesting feature and sections using BeautifulSoup library

2. BarnesAndNobel
- Crawled the Barnes & Nobel website and dived into more specifics like listing top 100 books, collecting URLs of top books -- landing on those URLs (automatically through code) and extracting information from those web pages

3. Github + SQL db
- Performed web scraping from Github API, extracted info of top 100 contributors using BeautifulSoup library
- Using pymysql (Python's MySQL library), created SQL database and tables to store the scraped information
The aim of this exercise is to get hands on with these operations: connecting to SQL Server using Python libraries, creating tables, inserting and updating scraped information and retrieving it as and when required.
